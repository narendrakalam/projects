Name Entity Recognition technique is used to detect entities from given input. Name Entity Recognition is done using the library named ‘spaCy’. Entities such as QUANTITY (E.g weight: fifty kilograms), MONEY(e.g. amount: thousand dollars), PROPER NOUNS are detected using this technique.
The package word2number is used to convert numbers written as ‘two thousand’ to ‘2000’. Furthermore, few lines of logical code adds suffix/prefix as $/kg,etc. depending upon type of entity.
